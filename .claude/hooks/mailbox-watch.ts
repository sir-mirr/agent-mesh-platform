/**
 * Idle-time mailbox watcher, for the Monitor tool (see CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * The hooks in `mailbox.ts` are event-driven: one fires when a turn starts, the
 * other when it ends. Neither fires while the session sits idle, so mail that
 * arrives with nobody typing waits for the next prompt — possibly hours, with
 * the other agent blocked that whole time on an answer already sent.
 *
 * This closes that gap. A shell-side poll costs nothing, so the model is woken
 * only when mail actually lands. A cron firing every ten minutes would instead
 * start a session each time to discover an empty inbox.
 *
 * **This peeks; it does not clear.** Two reasons. Bodies run to 10 MB and a
 * notification is not the place for one. And clearing here would race the Stop
 * hook, which is the component that actually delivers — dropping the message
 * into the gap between the two. So it reports ids and previews, the model wakes,
 * and `mailbox.ts` hands over the full text at the end of that turn.
 *
 * Ids come from a single counter in the mailer and only increase, so tracking a
 * high-water mark stays correct even after the hook empties the inbox.
