/**
 * Agent mailbox bridge (see CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * Codex builds the client in a separate repository and we coordinate through
 * agent-mesh-mailer. Checking by hand does not work: reading is non-destructive,
 * so an inbox nobody clears replays its whole history, and a turn that forgets
 * to look leaves the other side waiting on an answer that was never read.
 *
 * Two events:
 *
 *   UserPromptSubmit  fires before the turn starts. Any waiting mail is injected
 *                     as context, so it is read without being asked for.
 *   Stop              fires when the turn ends. Mail that landed *during* the
 *                     turn would otherwise sit until the next prompt — which may
 *                     be hours. Blocking here continues the turn to handle it.
 *
 * Both clear the inbox after reading. That is the only safe point to do it: the
 * mailer's DELETE clears everything rather than the ids just fetched, so the
 * gap between reading and clearing is a window where arriving mail is lost. Here
 * the gap is one round-trip; done by hand across a working turn it is minutes.
 *
 * Failure is always silent — no mailer running is the normal case on a machine
 * that is not doing cross-agent work, and a hook that complains about it would
 * cry wolf on every turn.
