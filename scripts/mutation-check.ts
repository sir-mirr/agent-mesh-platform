 * Break each guarded behaviour on purpose and check the suite notices.
 *
 *   bun run mutation-check              # every mutation
 *   bun run mutation-check -- egress    # ids containing "egress"
 *
 * ## Why this is a script and not a note in a document
 *
 * "This was mutation-tested" is a claim about work that happened once, and a
 * reader has no way to check it. Worse, the claim survives the guard: a
 * expectation deleted six months from now leaves the sentence in the commit
 * message exactly as true-sounding as it was.
 *
 * Every entry below is a defect that reached this repository, and the test named
 * beside it is what now stands between that defect and a release. Running this
 * re-establishes both facts in about two minutes.
 *
 * ## Refusals, and what each is for
 *
 * The refusals here are not about the tool failing to answer. They are about
 * the tool answering **wrongly**, which is worse, because a wrong answer here
 * gets acted on.
 *
 * **A dirty tree aborts.** Restoring is `git checkout --`, which is only safe
 * when the mutation is the sole difference. This is also the caveat that makes
 * `git checkout` acceptable at all: uncommitted work has been destroyed that way
 * in this repository before.
 *
 * **A pattern that matches nothing is a failure, not a skip.** The unmutated
 * source then runs, the suite passes, and it reads as "the guard did not catch
 * it" — a false finding rather than a missed one. That happened here with a
 * `perl` edit whose pattern had drifted.
 *
 * **A dirty tree afterwards is a failure.** The harness that found the defects
 * in `docs/decisions/checks-that-check-nothing.md` produced one itself: it kept
 * a single backup slot, so applying twice before restoring left a guard deleted
 * in a file that then reported four passes. There is no backup slot here — git
 * holds the original, which is the same reasoning that removed the hand-written
 * ignore list from `test/typecheck-scope.test.ts`. A copy is a second thing that
 * can be wrong.
